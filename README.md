My name is Keshav Bagrodia and i am currently in my 10th Grade.  I started coding 2 years back when i did a free course on codecdemy in which i didnt understand any thing 😜. But since then i have come a long long long way ahead. 

I am currently still learning to code but I know the bare minimum like the syntax and loops. To improve this knowledge i am currently ding the 30 days of code challenge on Hackerrank. My current Hackos on Hackerrank is 148, which is quite low so I am working on improving it.
