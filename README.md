My name is Keshav Bagrodia and i am currently in my 11th Grade.  I started coding 3 years back when i did a free course on codecdemy in which i didnt understand any thing ðŸ˜œ. But since then i have come a long long long way ahead. 

I am currently still learning to code but I know a decent amount. To improve this knowledge i am currently ding the 30 days of code challenge on Hackerrank. I am also learing django from Nick Walter's Course on Udemy
